                hi! i'm bao — i write code, break things, and learn from the rubble.
                i studied computer science at the university of connecticut and
                am currently pursuing my masters at georgia tech.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                since then, i've worked on backend systems in the insurance
                space, but my interests lie closer to the metal — systems
                programming, graphics, trading, and anything that smells like
                bit-twiddling and memory alignment.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                this blog is where i document what i'm learning — things like 
                os internals, rendering, and maybe some occasional game
                development. i’m big on self-teaching and deep work, and i'm not 
                afraid to rewrite something from scratch just to understand it.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                thanks for stopping by! if you ever want to chat about code 
                or cursed C++, feel free to reach out!
